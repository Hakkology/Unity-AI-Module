# Unity AI Module

This repository has been created for AI programming practice in Unity. Its purpose is to develop modules that encompass various AI design patterns and techniques, thereby enhancing knowledge and skills in this area.

## Modules

The following AI structures are included in this project and will be continuously updated and expanded:

### Finite State Machine (FSM)

- **Purpose**: To enable behavior changes according to specific situations.
- **Use Cases**: Character AI behaviors, in-game state management.

### Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)

- **Purpose**: To facilitate intelligent and flexible movements of game characters through goal-oriented behavior planning.
- **Use Cases**: Complex task execution by NPCs, strategy games.

### Behavior Tree

- **Purpose**: To create more complex and dynamic AI behaviors.
- **Use Cases**: Flexible AI behaviors in various game scenarios.
